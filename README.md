# go-rest

A simple REST API written in Go.

## Goals for the project

* Content not super important for now, more about understanding the implementation.
* Implement a `CRUD` style API - `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE` and `DELTE`.
* Unmarshall Json into Go structs.
* Leverate Bazel to build a docker container.

## Longer term / future iterations

* Relevant/interesting content.
* Hosting - GCP?
* Discord implementation?
